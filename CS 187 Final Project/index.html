              <h2>A quote that keeps me motivated to succeed</h2>
              <p>&quot;If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like it. You
                will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life
                straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.&quot;</p>

                <h3>Personal Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I enjoy engineering, lifting weights, gaming, film critque and philosophy. You'll
                  see some of my engineering projects at the bottom of the page which I worked
                  tirelessly on. I have been into lifting weights for years now, and games and
                  films help fill my spare time. I enjoy discussing both political and religious philosophy.</p>

                <h3>Studies at UMass Boston</h3>
                <p>I'm a freshman Computer Science major with a minor in German at UMass Boston. I plan to
                earn my BS in Computer Science degree by 2024, and hopefully by then reach fluency in German.
                I chose to study Computer Science to become a game designer and German because of my heritage,
                interest in the culture, and my desire to travel to the country one day.</p>

                <p>To the left is the logo for the video-game company Mimimi Games based in Munich, Germany.
                  I hope to contribute my learned knowledge of programming in Java and C to the gaming industry
                  and create things that people love. This is one of several gaming studios I aspire to work
                  for after I graduate.</p>

                  <p>I had learned much about the compromise that the American government makes in
                  citizens' digital privacy in the name of "counterterrorism" from CIA whistleblower

                  <p>This discussion surrounding escapism into video games was one I was passionate
                  about and considered personally. I love video games but also acknowledge that they

                  <p>I have always considered the methods of breaking encrypted code to be
                  fascinating, and those who do it to be quite intellectual. I hope that cybersecurity
                  software can stay ahead of malevolent code breakers in the future.</p>

                  <p>It is simultaneously incredible and also eerie how robots continue to progress
                  towards human levels of mobility and function. I hope that this growing industry

                  <p>I have been recently getting more interested in theoretical physics and
                    astrophysics, so this topic was somewhat familiar to me. I hope to study
                    these subjects further once I finish with my Computer Science degree.</p>

                  <p>This was my personal favorite project in which I learned the most about 3D
                    modeling in AutoCAD. The cannon swivels and shoots and different angles, as
                    shown in the video. It took me hours of work and I am very satisfied with
