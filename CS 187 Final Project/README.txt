READ ME:

I imported some code and ideas from two of my own projects from an Intensive Codecademy Course "Web Design from Scratch" I took during a gap year in 2018. I implemented elements from both of these projects in order to make the best website I could manage from my cumulative knowledge in HTML and CSS. I used a public domain reset.css file in addition to my style.css file, which is credited in its file.

Thank you for granting me an extension until Friday to complete this project. Happy holidays!
